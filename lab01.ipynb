        "3. `[pandas]` is derived from the term **panel data**, an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. — Wikipedia.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In this session, we will go over the essential bits of information about pandas, including how to install it, its uses, and how it works with other common Python data analysis packages such as matplotlib and scikit-learn.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like\n",
        "        * What's the average, median, max, or min of each column?\n",
        "        * Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
        "        * What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
        "        \n",
        "    * Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",
        "    * Visualize the data with help from `Matplotlib`. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more.\n",
        "    * Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Pandas** is built on top of the `NumPy` package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in `SciPy`, plotting functions from `Matplotlib`, and machine learning algorithms in `Scikit-learn`.\n",
